Used Jupyter note book to perform EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and hyper parameter tuning.

Then created a pipeline and packaged the machine learning model using docker file and also created a fast api application.

Then configured the github repository and also the webhook setting.

with the help of jenkins ran pytest and docker container in EC2 instance.

With the help of jenkins performed the continuous integration, continuous training and continuous deployment pipeline.

Thank you.
